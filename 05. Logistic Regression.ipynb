The answer is parallelization is better handled through sklearn, separating out each classification, and the operations are ALL in lower level c++. **The main reason, however, is that  the update used is more advanced than what we have talked about.** They have an array of solvers that use the gradient (and Hessian) to solve the optimization more quickly. The accuracy is higher because this logistic regression object uses regularization, which helps control for over-learning, and also because the optimization allows for finer steps when we get to places where the gradient is small and the objective function is less well behaved. \n",
