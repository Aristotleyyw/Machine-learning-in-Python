    "We use the data of 2016 US president debate, which contains three presidential debates between Hillary Cliton and Donald Trump as well as one vice presidental debate between Tim Kaine and Mike Pence. The debate is highly competitive and attract worldwide attention. As we known, the result of the president election is so unexpected, so we will compare the behavior differences in the debate between Hillary Cliton and Donald Trump in multiple aspects, like how many words they said, how large the vocabulary they have, how many times they laugh and applaud, and the most frequency words they used.

       "'Good evening from Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. I\\'m Lester Holt, anchor of \"NBC Nightly News.\" I want to welcome you to the first presidential debate. The participants tonight are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization. The commission drafted tonight\\'s format, and the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns. The 90-minute debate is divided into six segments, each 15 minutes long. We\\'ll explore three topic areas tonight: Achieving prosperity; America\\'s direction; and securing America. At the start of each segment, I will ask the same lead-off question to both candidates, and they will each have up to two minutes to respond. From that point until the end of the segment, we\\'ll have an open discussion. The questions are mine and have not been shared with the commission or the campaigns. The audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying. I will invite you to applaud, however, at this moment, as we welcome the candidates: Democratic nominee for president of the United States, Hillary Clinton, and Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald J. Trump.'"

       " 'how are you donald',\n",
       " 'good luck to you',\n",
       " \"well i don't expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight but i remind everyone there are two more presidential debates scheduled we are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important and we're going to press for specifics i am honored to have this role but this evening belongs to the candidates and just as important to the american people candidates we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions as well as your visions and your values so let's begin we're calling this opening segment achieving prosperity and central to that is jobs there are two economic realities in america today there's been a record six straight years of job growth and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation however income inequality remains significant and nearly half of americans are living paycheck to paycheck beginning with you secretary clinton why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of american works\",\n",
       " \"well thank you lester and thanks to hofstra for hosting us the central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together today is my granddaughter's second birthday so i think about this a lot first we have to build an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top that means we need new jobs good jobs with rising incomes i want us to invest in you i want us to invest in your future that means jobs in infrastructure in advanced manufacturing innovation and technology clean renewable energy and small business because most of the new jobs will come from small business we also have to make the economy fairer that starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee finally equal pay for women's work\",\n",
       " \"i also want to see more companies do profitsharing if you help create the profits you should be able to share in them not just the executives at the top and i want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work i've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you're under so let's have paid family leave earned sick days let's be sure we have affordable child care and debtfree college how are we going to do it we're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes finally we tonight are on the stage together donald trump and i donald it's good to be with you we're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country you have to judge us who can shoulder the immense awesome responsibilities of the presidency who can put into action the plans that will make your life better i hope that i will be able to earn your vote on november 8th\",\n",
       " \"secretary clinton thank you mr trump the same question to you it's about putting money  more money into the pockets of american workers you have up to two minutes\",\n",
       " \"thank you lester our jobs are fleeing the country they're going to mexico they're going to many other countries you look at what china is doing to our country in terms of making our product they're devaluing their currency and there's nobody in our government to fight them and we have a very good fight and we have a winning fight because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild china and many other countries are doing the same thing so we're losing our good jobs so many of them when you look at what's happening in mexico a friend of mine who builds plants said it's the eighth wonder of the world they're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world some of the most sophisticated some of the best plants with the united states as he said not so much so ford is leaving you see that their small car division leaving thousands of jobs leaving michigan leaving ohio they're all leaving and we can't allow it to happen anymore as far as child care is concerned and so many other things i think hillary and i agree on that we probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do but perhaps we'll be talking about that later but we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us we have to stop our companies from leaving the united states and with it firing all of their people all you have to do is take a look at carrier air conditioning in indianapolis they left  fired 1400 people they're going to mexico so many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this\",\n",
       " \"we cannot let it happen under my plan i'll be reducing taxes tremendously from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies small and big businesses that's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since ronald reagan it's going to be a beautiful thing to watch companies will come they will build they will expand new companies will start and i look very very much forward to doing it we have to renegotiate our trade deals and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs\",\n",
       " 'secretary clinton would you like to respond',\n",
       " \"well i think that trade is an important issue of course we are 5 percent of the world's population we have to trade with the other 95 percent and we need to have smart fair trade deals we also though need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions and the kind of plan that donald has put forth would be trickledown economics all over again in fact it would be the most extreme version the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had i call it trumpedup trickledown because that's exactly what it would be that is not how we grow the economy we just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes i think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives i understand that you know donald was very fortunate in his life and that's all to his benefit he started his business with $14 million borrowed from his father and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there i don't buy that i have a different experience my father was a smallbusinessman he worked really hard he printed drapery fabrics on long tables where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going and so what i believe is the more we can do for the middle class the more we can invest in you your education your skills your future the better we will be off and the better we'll grow that's the kind of economy i want us to see again\",\n",
       " \"let me follow up with mr trump if you can you've talked about creating 25 million jobs and you've promised to bring back millions of jobs for americans how are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas how specifically are you going to tell american manufacturers that you have to come back\",\n",
       " \"well for one thing  and before we start on that  my father gave me a very small loan in 1975 and i built it into a company that's worth many many billions of dollars with some of the greatest assets in the world and i say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs our country's in deep trouble we don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world especially china they're the best the best ever at it what they're doing to us is a very very sad thing so we have to do that we have to renegotiate our trade deals and lester they're taking our jobs they're giving incentives they're doing things that frankly we don't do let me give you the example of mexico they have a vat tax we're on a different system when we sell into mexico there's a tax when they sell in  automatic 16 percent approximately when they sell into us there's no tax it's a defective agreement it's been defective for a long time many years but the politicians haven't done anything about it now in all fairness to secretary clinton  yes is that ok good i want you to be very happy it's very important to me but in all fairness to secretary clinton when she started talking about this it was really very recently she's been doing this for 30 years and why hasn't she made the agreements better the nafta agreement is defective just because of the tax and many other reasons but just because of the fact\",\n",
       " 'let me interrupt just a moment but',\n",
       " \"secretary clinton and others politicians should have been doing this for years not right now because of the fact that we've created a movement they should have been doing this for years what's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is  look we owe $20 trillion we cannot do it any longer lester\",\n",
       " 'back to the question though how do you bring back  specifically bring back jobs american manufacturers how do you make them bring the jobs back',\n",
       " \"well the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave the companies are leaving i could name i mean there are thousands of them they're leaving and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever and what you do is you say fine you want to go to mexico or some other country good luck we wish you a lot of luck but if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax you're wrong and once you say you're going to have to tax them coming in and our politicians never do this because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave because in many cases they own the companies so what i'm saying is we can stop them from leaving we have to stop them from leaving and that's a big big factor\",\n",
       " 'let me let secretary clinton get in here',\n",
       " \"well let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago we had the worst financial crisis the great recession the worst since the 1930s that was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy failed to invest in the middle class took their eyes off of wall street and created a perfect storm in fact donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis he said back in 2006 gee i hope it does collapse because then i can go in and buy some and make some money well it did collapse\",\n",

       " 'mr trump',\n",
       " \"she talks about solar panels we invested in a solar company our country that was a disaster they lost plenty of money on that one now look i'm a great believer in all forms of energy but we're putting a lot of people out of work our energy policies are a disaster our country is losing so much in terms of energy in terms of paying off our debt you can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt the obama administration from the time they've come in is over 230 years' worth of debt and he's topped it he's doubled it in a course of almost eight years sevenandahalf years to be semi exact so i will tell you this we have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs and we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand because they're not doing it and all you have to do is look at michigan and look at ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving they're gone and hillary i'd just ask you this you've been doing this for 30 years why are you just thinking about these solutions right now for 30 years you've been doing it and now you're just starting to think of solutions\",\n",

       " 'mr trump thank you ',\n",
       " \"we now have about 10 minutes for an open discussion i want to focus on two issues that in fact by the justices that you name could end up changing the existing law of the land first is one that you mentioned mr trump and that is guns secretary clinton you said last year let me quote the supreme court is wrong on the second amendment and now in fact in the 2008 heller case the court ruled that there is a constitutional right to bear arms but a right that is reasonably limited those were the words of the judge antonin scalia who wrote the decision what's wrong with that \",\n",
       " \"well first of all i support the second amendment i lived in arkansas for 18 wonderful years i represented upstate new york i understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership it goes back to the founding of our country but i also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation because i support the second amendment doesn't mean that i want people who shouldn't have guns to be able to threaten you kill you or members of your family and so when i think about what we need to do we have 33000 people a year who die from guns i think we need comprehensive background checks need to close the online loophole close the gun show loophole there's other matters that i think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the second amendment you mentioned the heller decision and what i was saying that you referenced chris was that i disagreed with the way the court applied the second amendment in that case because what the district of columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them and the court didn't accept that reasonable regulation but they've accepted many others so i see no conflict between saving people's lives and defending the second amendment \",\n",
       " \"let me bring mr trump in here the bipartisan open debate coalition got millions of votes on questions to ask here and this was in fact one of the top questions that they got how will you ensure the second amendment is protected you just heard secretary clinton's answer does she persuade you that while you may disagree on regulation that in fact she supports a second amendment right to bear arms \",\n",
       " 'well the dc vs heller decision was very strongly  and she was extremely angry about it i watched i mean she was very very angry when upheld and justice scalia was so involved and it was a wellcrafted decision but hillary was extremely upset extremely angry and people that believe in the second amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say ',\n",
       " 'well let me bring in secretary clinton were you extremely upset ',\n",
       " \"well i was upset because unfortunately dozens of toddlers injure themselves even kill people with guns because unfortunately not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions but there's no doubt that i respect the second amendment that i also believe there's an individual right to bear arms that is not in conflict with sensible commonsense regulation and you know look i understand that donald's been strongly supported by the nra the gun lobby's on his side they're running millions of dollars of ads against me and i regret that because what i would like to see is for people to come together and say of course we're going to protect and defend the second amendment but we're going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33000 lives that we lose every year \",\n",

       " 'because roe v wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account and when i voted as a senator i did not think that that was the case the kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking painful decisions for families to make i have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy i do not think the united states government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions so you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account ',\n",

       " \"well i think it's terrible if you go with what hillary is saying in the ninth month you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby now you can say that that's ok and hillary can say that that's ok but it's not ok with me because based on what she's saying and based on where she's going and where she's been you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day and that's not acceptable \",\n",
       " \"well that is not what happens in these cases and using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate you should meet with some of the women that i have met with women i have known over the course of my life this is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make and i do not believe the government should be making it you know i've had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country i've been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions like they used to do in china or forced women to bear children like they used to do in romania and i can tell you the government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith with medical advice and i will stand up for that right \",\n",
